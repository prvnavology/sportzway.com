                    <h3>Clubs to Avoid at the Start of 2024/25 Fantasy Premier League</h3>
                    <p>The Scout explains why early interest in Brentford, Arsenal, and Wolves assets may be
                        limited
                    </p>
                    <h3>Arsenal </h3>
                    <p>The Gunners were among the most reliable sides in Fantasy last season, excelling at both
                        ends of the pitch. Mikel Arteta’s men recorded a league-high 18 clean sheets, with Ben
                        White, William Saliba, and Gabriel topping the defender standings. Additionally, four of
                        Arsenal’s midfielders – Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Kai Havertz, and Declan Rice –
                        scored over 160 points each.
                        However, their early fixtures are daunting, likely reducing the appeal of their players for
                        initial
                        squads. Arsenal will face three of last season’s top five teams – Aston Villa, Tottenham
                        Hotspur, and Manchester City – in their first five matches, each scoring at least four in the
                        FDR.
                        On the plus side, Arsenal will also host Wolverhampton Wanderers and Brighton & Hove
                        Albion during this period. Nonetheless, many managers may opt for players from other clubs
                        with more favorable early schedules.</p>
                    <h3>Brentford</h3>
                    <p>The Bees have a similarly challenging start, with three tough away games paired with two
                        more manageable home fixtures. While Brentford will play Crystal Palace and Southampton
                        at home in the first five Gameweeks, they will also travel to face three of last season’s top
                        five – Liverpool, Manchester City, and Spurs.
                        As a result, Brentford’s key attackers, Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney, might be overlooked
                        by many managers until their schedule improves in Gameweek 6. From that point, the Bees
                        will have three favorable home matches in the next four Gameweeks against West Ham
                        United, Wolves, and Ipswich Town.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Wolves</h3>
                    <p>Wolves face a brutal start to the season, making their players likely candidates to be avoided
                        until late October. Gary O’Neil’s team will go up against six of last season’s top seven sides
                        in their first eight fixtures. This tough run begins with an away game at Arsenal and
                        concludes with a home match against Manchester City in Gameweek 8.
                        However, Wolves’ fixtures improve significantly from Gameweek 9-17, with seven of their
                        nine matches scoring just two in the FDR. During this period, Rayan Ait-Nouri stands out as
                        a solid defensive option, while Pedro Neto, Hwang Hee-chan, and Matheus Cunha could
                        offer excellent value in attack.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Wolves’ First Eight Matches </h3>
