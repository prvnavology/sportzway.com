                                In recent years, the introduction of Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology has
                                sparked
                                numerous debates and discussions across the footballing world. Its influence extends
                                beyond the pitch, significantly altering the dynamics of fantasy football leagues,
                                including

                            <p> VAR was introduced to minimize errors in key moments of matches, such as goals,
                                penalties, and red card decisions. Its implementation involves video replays and a team
                                of
                                officials reviewing incidents from a control room, advising the referee on potential
                                mistakes.
