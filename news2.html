                    <h3>Macklin Celebrini, But Do the Sharks Hold Back His Fantasy Value?</h3>
                    <p>The first overall pick in the 2024 draft will be tasked with turning around a team that had one
                        of the worst seasons ever in the cap era.
                        Macklin Celebrini is a highly anticipated prospect for the 2024-25 season. He was the
                        consensus top prospect throughout his draft class, making the Sharks' selection of him
                        almost a given. Mike Grier even hinted at this choice when introducing Ryan Warsofsky as
                        the new head coach.
                        Though Celebrini isn’t projected to reach the same level as Connor Bedard, he is expected
                        to be a top-tier first-line center with excellent goal-scoring ability and a strong two-way
                        game.
                        His high hockey IQ suggests he’ll adapt well to the NHL. Celebrini had an outstanding
                        college season at Boston University, becoming the youngest ever to win the Hobey Baker
                        Award, and shone at the World Juniors.
                        What Can We Expect in Celebrini's First NHL Season, and What Will Be His Impact in
                        Fantasy?
                        The Sharks won’t be as bad as they were last season. In the cap era, the 2023-24 Sharks
                        had the second-lowest points percentage (.287) and the 12th-worst offense (2.20 GF/GP).
                        With Celebrini in the lineup, they’ll have a young offensive dynamo who can create scoring
                        opportunities. They’ve also bolstered their roster with proven veterans like Jake Walman,
                        Barclay Goodrow, Tyler Toffoli, and Alex Wennberg. William Eklund, Thomas Bordeleau, and
                        Filip Bystedt are expected to develop further, and Logan Couture should be healthy.
                        However, the roster remains thin, especially on the blue line and in net, likely keeping the
                        Sharks in the bottom tier.
                        Only five rookies in the cap era have averaged over a point per game. In the past five
                        seasons, the highest marks were set by Kirill Kaprizov (0.93) and Bedard (0.90), with four
                        others (Jason Robertson, Matt Boldy, Trevor Zegras, Michael Bunting) finishing with at least
                        0.80 P/GP.
                        If a generational talent like Bedard could only muster 0.90 P/GP, Celebrini’s production will
                        likely be lower. Kaprizov was an older rookie and already a KHL star, making him a poor
                        comparable. Robertson played a shortened season, Zegras had a full pro season split
                        between the AHL and NHL before his rookie year, and Boldy played on a good team.
                        Bunting had prior pro experience and played on a strong team.
                        A 0.70 P/GP scoring pace for Celebrini would be impressive, translating to nearly 60 points
                        in a season. This makes Celebrini a valuable pick in the middle rounds of redraft leagues,
                        with potential for more. In keeper/dynasty leagues, Celebrini has immense value.
                        Two Major Factors Dictate Celebrini's Fantasy Value: Ice Time and Role
                        Ice Time: Despite a logjam at center with Couture, Wennberg, and Mikael Granlund,
                        Celebrini will get top-six ice time with some power play duties. Like Bedard in Chicago,
                        there’s no immediate pressure to win, and it’s in both Celebrini and the Sharks' best interests
                        to give him ample reps for development.
                        The Sharks have been willing to play their rookies. Eklund averaged 16:55 TOI in his first 17
                        NHL games and 18:39 in his first full season. Under David Quinn, who was previously
                        criticized for not playing Kaapo Kakko and Alexis Lafrenière enough with the Rangers,
                        Eklund saw significant ice time.
                        Assuming Celebrini scores at an above-average rate, note that in the past five seasons (min.
                        25 GP), the lowest TOI/GP among rookies who averaged 0.5 P/GP was 13:17 (Pavel
                        Dorofeyev), while five averaged over 18 minutes (six if including Zegras at 17:54 TOI/GP).
                        Celebrini is likely to average at least 16 minutes per game, with significant power play time.
                        As a comparable, Jack Hughes and Tim Stützle both averaged around 13 minutes at even
                        strength and three minutes on the power play in their rookie seasons, enough for Celebrini to
                        be productive.
                        Role: While the Sharks have four centers signed for next season – Couture, Granlund,
                        Wennberg, and Nico Sturm – plus Will Smith, drafted fourth overall in 2023, Celebrini's
                        versatility allows him to play wing or center. His offensive output will depend on who he plays
                        with, and for maximum fantasy value, he needs to play with a good playmaker or finisher.
                        On the power play, Celebrini’s role is also crucial. Will he be the focal point or a supporting
                        player? Will he be allowed to shoot the puck frequently, or serve as a set-up man?
                        Injury Luck: Celebrini’s durability in the NHL’s physically demanding environment is a
                        concern. Bedard and Connor McDavid both suffered unlucky injuries. Over the past five
                        seasons, only 34 rookies played at least 70 games.
                        The Ducks intentionally limited Leo Carlsson’s games last season to prevent burnout, and
                        the Sharks might do the same with Celebrini to protect their franchise player.
                        If Celebrini returns to Boston U for his sophomore season, this discussion becomes moot.
                        Boston U lost to Denver in the semis, and Celebrini could play with Cole Eiserman, who joins
                        Boston U in the fall. Celebrini and Eiserman were high school teammates before Eiserman
                        joined the NTDP and Celebrini joined the USHL’s Chicago Steel.
                        Regardless, Celebrini is already turning heads at the Sharks’ development camp and is a
                        player to watch for the 2024-25 fantasy hockey season.
